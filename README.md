# Movie_Recommendation
# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python and Machine Learning** techniques.  
It recommends movies similar to a given movie based on **content similarity** using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

The system analyzes movie **overviews and genres** to find similarities between movies and suggests relevant recommendations.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Loads movie dataset (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`)
2. Preprocesses text data (overview + genres)
3. Converts text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**
4. Calculates similarity using **Cosine Similarity**
5. Recommends top N similar movies based on input title
